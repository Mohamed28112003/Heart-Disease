# Heart-Disease
## Introduction 
this project aims to analyze a heart disease dataset and build machine learning
models to predict the presence of heart disease in patients based on several clinical features.
We will apply various preprocessing techniques to handle missing values, encode categorical
features, convert data types, remove outliers, and drop unnecessary columns. We will also
perform several analysis and visualization techniques to understand the relationship between
the different features and the target variable.
